Roadmap & TODO

## ✅ Completed

-   [x] `<link rel="stylesheet">` scoping enforced (parser prevents local files, CDN allowed)

-   [x] Component-scoped CSS with `<style src>`
-   [x] PascalCase and snake_case component support

## 🚀 Next Up

### 1. Comprehensive README

### 2. More Complex Component Examples

-   [ ] Form components with validation
-   [ ] Modal/Dialog components
-   [ ] Nested component composition patterns

### 3. Developer Experience
