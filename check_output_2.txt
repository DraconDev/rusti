error: Inline <style> tags not allowed in Azumi 2.0
       
       CSS must be external:
         ✅ <style src="components/card.css" />  (auto-scoped)
         ❌ <style>.card { padding: 2em; }</style>
       
       For dynamic styles: use style attribute with expressions
       
       Why? External files get full IDE support (linting, autocomplete, error checking).
