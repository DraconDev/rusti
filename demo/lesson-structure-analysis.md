- Every lesson includes practical exercises
- Build-on projects that span multiple lessons
- Interactive code examples

### 3. **Better Prerequisites**
- Clear learning objectives for each lesson
- Prerequisites clearly stated
- Optional "review" sections for complex topics

### 4. **Comprehensive Coverage**
- More lessons for thorough coverage
- Advanced topics get dedicated lessons
- Specialization path for different use cases

### 5. **Better Learning Path**
- Clear progression from beginner to advanced
- Multiple entry points for different skill levels
- Optional deep-dive sections

## Implementation Strategy:

### Immediate Improvements:
1. **Expand Lesson 1** to include more context
2. **Split complex lessons** into smaller, focused ones
3. **Add prerequisite notes** to each lesson
4. **Include more exercises** in existing lessons

### Content Additions:
1. **Interactive code playground** for each lesson
2. **Build-along projects** that span multiple lessons
3. **Common pitfalls** section for each lesson
4. **Challenge exercises** for advanced learners

### Assessment & Practice:
