### Tasks

## TODO

- what about --var that we added before? do we still need it?

- how to handle global?
  - we would also need a global tag for the style 
- i think we allow <div style={...} but perhaps with only variables, this would allow us to cut --var peculiarity we have now

- make the lessons 

## Done

- snake case for css?
- list-style should be list_style
