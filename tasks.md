# TODO

- what about --var that we added before? do we still need it?

- how to handle global?
  - we would also need a global tag for the style <style global>
- i think we allow <div style={...}> and we type check it, this would allow us to cut --var peculiarity we have now

# Done

- snake case for css?
- list-style should be list_style

# ? Much later 
- maybe improve css validation 
- make the lessons
