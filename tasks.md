### Tasks

## TODO

- snake case for css?
- what about --var that we added before? do we still need it?
- ban style! in html!
- list-style should be list_style
- we would also need a global tag for the style 

- this would mean we ban external css files, inline css, and classes with spaces, but also we don't support tailwind at all, 
- this is the best solution if we can do it, cause external css only guarantees names to be correct not values, while tailwind is trash, and i guess we can do inline styles and check them but that is not descriptive so that fails there, using variables as classes is the best solution
