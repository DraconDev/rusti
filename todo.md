make sure we have great error messages for all cases 


<!-- wait before we proceed regarding lesson 14 we do have a possible bug that what you create the rust file write in it, then create teh css we are getting 

ailed to read CSS file '/home/dracon/_Dev/_Fun/azumi/demo/static/pages/lesson14.css': No such file or directory (os error 2)rust-analyzermacro-error
azumi_macros
proc_macro html

now i think it work but our rust analyzer shows it as an error  -->

all forms must have bind=

one but that if we make a css file rust analyzer doesn't realize we have it, and keeps showing it as an error, i think we need to add a custom rule to our rust analyzer to ignore this, or not sure what to do
