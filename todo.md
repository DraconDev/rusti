datastar doesnt seem to work, the advanced examples also seems to cause trouble iwth the single ' in the html

we need to update the docs to include the "" or {} exceptions for rate cases like 2em

ask how leptos and dioxus and other frameworks handle this like we are doing but other templating langs too, like askama,tera, etc

also Name✨ emojis are invalid we need to fix that
